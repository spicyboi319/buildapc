### Why use this guide?

The goal for this guide is to create the world's most in depth resource about how to build a computer and for it to be useful for everyone who reads it.

That means that this guide is great if you are building a computer for the first time, haven't done it in awhile, or it is your full time job. Even if you are pretty good at building PCs, hopefully you will learn something. 

I felt that my guide would be very useful, but didn't want to put it into a book. I don't know everything and wanted to be able to make changes over time. I first tried using Wix, but quickly found that it costs way too much (for what it is) and others would not be able to contribute. Now I'm trying out GitHub, as others can contribute, and it's free.

### Support or Contact

Having trouble with your build, or just want to say thanks? I have created a [Discord server](discord.gg) for people to chat about PCs. If you aren't having any luck there, there are tons of other resources on the internet. Just Bing it ;=D.
