## spicyboi319's guide on building a computer

### What's first?
The first thing that we need to do is discuss three common budgets that I like to call: The Potato, The Mid-Ranger, and The Athlete. 

#### The Potato budget refers to PCs that fall under the price of $500 or under. 
For the longest time, PCs under the $500 price point, well- haven't been very good. In the past couple of years, with the introduction of AMD's Ryzen processors (and their APU siblings), have allowed for PC gaming to be accessable to almost anyone. Before the introduction of Ryzen, if you were at the $500 price point or lower, in order to have money for a graphics card and still get a brand new processor you would have been stuck with a low-end i3 or a Pentium CPU. Each of these options were only dual core and some of which would even cause bottlenecks in games. Now, even if you only have like 500 bucks to spend on a computer, you can still get a pretty decent computer. Here's a pre-compiled part list that fits into your budget of just 500 bucks. Keep in mind, the case is subjective and you might want to get a different one. If you have some extra money, you can get more RAM or a bigger SSD. This is all perfectly fine by me. This is a good time to touch on one of the wonderful things about PC. You aren't locked down to a single configuration and you can make your own PC unique to you. These are just the parts I fit into the budget. Don't forget, you can always upgrade these parts in the future and you aren't locked down to this specific configuration.
