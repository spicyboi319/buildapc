## spicyboi319's guide on building a computer

### What's first?
The first thing that we need to do is discuss three common budgets that I like to call: The Graduate, The Success Story, and The Boss. 

#### The Graduate budget refers to PCs that fall under the price of $500 or under. 
For the longest time, PCs under the $500 price point, well- haven't been very good. In the past couple of years, with the introduction of AMD's Ryzen processors (and their APU siblings), have allowed for PC gaming to be accessable to almost anyone. Before the introduction of Ryzen, if you were at the $500 price point or lower, in order to have money for a graphics card and still get a brand new processor you would have been stuck with a low-end i3 or a Pentium CPU. Each of these options were only dual core and some of which would even cause bottlenecks in games. Now, even if you only have like 500 bucks to spend on a computer, you can still get a pretty decent computer. This is a good time to touch on one of the many wonderful things about PC. You aren't locked down to a single configuration and you can make your own PC specific to your use case. The reason that this computer is nicknamed The Graduate is because, ju


#### The Success Story costs around $750-1250.
This is a pretty good ammount to spend on a PC. Anything that you build in this range today will most likely be pretty decent for the next couple of years.
